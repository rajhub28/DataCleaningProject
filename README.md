Data Cleaning Project
=====================

To run the run_analysis.R script, you must make sure that the following files
and folder are available in the working directory:

* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt
* test/X_test.txt
* test/y_test.txt
* test/subject_test.txt
* train/X_train.txt
* train/y_train.txt
* train/subject_train.txt

The script also requires the following two R libraries:

* data.table
* dplyr

The script when run produces the output today data set in 
a file named "tidyData.txt"

The Code Book for tidyData.txt is available at [link](codeBook.md).
